# Known issues
There is an error trying to connect to the vpn with 2 errors:

 - The gateway id is different from the ip address of the iz vpn. You can find
 it by doing `journalctl`
 - The secrets are stored only for the internal weird gatewayid. You can fix it
 by adding the required secret to a new secret file:

 ```
 sudo vim /etc/ipsec.d/manual.secrets`

# Add 
<localiphere> - <ping izvpn here> : PSK <pre shared secret lastpass>
 ````
